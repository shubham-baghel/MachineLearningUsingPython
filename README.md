## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

## How it works?

Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.

## Application of ML

Any technology user today has benefitted from machine learning. Facial recognition technology allows social media platforms to help users tag and share photos of friends. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology converts images of text into movable type. Recommendation engines, powered by machine learning, suggest what movies or television shows to watch next based on user preferences. Self-driving cars that rely on machine learning to navigate may soon be available to consumers.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains Machine learning project on various differnt type of DataSets from Real world.

## Table of Content
* [House Price Prection](#house-price-prediction)
* [Credit Card Fraudlent](#credit-card-fraudlent)

### [House Price Prediction](./HousePricePrediction)

* This Dataset contains data of house prices with features of the houses.
* We have done EDA and found out the features affecting house prices.
* Applied linear regression models and compared the performance of models.

### [Credit Card Fraudlent](./Credit-Card-Fraudlent)

* The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
* The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
* Applied Isolation Forest, Local Outlier and Support Vector Classifier to detect fraudlent transaction.
